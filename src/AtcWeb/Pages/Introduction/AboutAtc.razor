                    Short answer; Just names.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We had to come up with a name that was short and not a company name,
                    as we wanted an organization which was fully open sourced and not backed financially by any company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since our first repository was a .NET project,
                    we came up with ATC for the first repository and then ATC-NET as our organization name.

            <SectionHeader Title="How it started" />
            <SectionContent AutoMarginContent="false" FullWidth="true">
                <p>
                    It all started with two colleagues who worked together for a long time for different customers on different projects,
                    where code was being copied around from private code bases to project code bases over and over again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One day, then one guy said to the other guy, we should put this common code into an open-source repository
                    and make some Nuget packages, which we can then download and utilize instead.
                    After this the process started, which involved tasks such as; Coming up with a name, selecting a platform for hosting the code, selecting licenses, defining workflows, rules etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GitHub was selected as the code platform, MIT license for all repositories, and a simple setup with workflows for commits and package distribution was defined.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the first two colleagues started, many more good colleagues joined.
                    Other developers and hopefully many new will follow.

            <SectionContent AutoMarginContent="false" FullWidth="true">
                <p>
                    The main purpose is to make a good, solid and stable toolbox with code and snippets based on many years of developer experience,
                    which can be used in many projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we work on any projects, we can proudly say the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>We share common code.</li>
                        <li>We are not afraid of showing our code.</li>
                        <li>When we leave, the code will stay in github and continue to be improved and documented through other projects.</li>
                        <li>Projects can adopt the code themselves and everybody is free to fork the code</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today we use several programming languages as well as technologies.
                    Therefore, we strive to be somewhat disciplined in the repository structure, naming and versioning scheme.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Specifically around C# and .NET target framework:
                    <ul>
                        <li>We will try to be on the latest new LTS version from Microsoft - (Currently C# 10 / .NET 6).</li>
                        <li>We try as much as we can to be cross platform independent (support Linux, MacOS and Windows).</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    To make a contribution to a repository, just follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow. <MudLink Href="https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962">Read more here.</MudLink>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The simple steps are:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fork the repo on GitHub</li>
                        <li>Clone the project to your own machine</li>
                        <li>Commit changes to your own branch</li>
                        <li>Push your work back up to your fork</li>
                        <li>Submit a pull request (PR) so atc members, can review your changes</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    NOTE: Be sure to merge with the latest code from "upstream" before making a pull request!

                    Currently we have the following repository workflow:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A PR will trigger 'pre-integration', that builds and tests the code.</li>
                        <li>On a successful PR, code can be approved.</li>
                        <li>Once the PR is merged into the 'main' branch, this will trigger the 'post-integration' workflow, which; Builds, tests and publishes artifacts/packages to 'GitHub Package Registry' or PyPi test package index.</li>
                        <li>On a successful merge process, code can now be released to Nuget/PyPi package indexes.</li>
                        <li>Releasing, is a manual workflow trigger. Once used it will; Build and publish artifacts/packages to 'Nuget Package Registry'/PyPi package indexes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                    We follow the coding guidelines defined in the repository <MudLink Href="https://github.com/atc-net/atc-coding-rules">ATC-Coding-Rules</MudLink>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These ATC-Coding-Rules are  based on .editorconfig files.
                    Furthermore for .NET projects/solutions we are using a range of Roslyn Analyzers.
